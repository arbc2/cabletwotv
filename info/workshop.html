<h1>Guidelines for The Workshop</h1><p>

<b>Be Kind, Supportive, and Excited:</b>
we're all here to have fun and make art happen. create a positive and encouraging environment where members can freely express their ideas, offer feedback, and collaborate with others. <p>

<b>Patience:</b> 
projects can take time, and people may not respond for a while after posting! likewise, feel free to engage and contribute at your own pace and discretion.<p>

<b>No Expectations: </b>
everything is chill. remember that participation and collaboration are voluntary! no one is obligated to contribute to works. sometimes people may not be able to fulfill requests or meet certain expectations. there won't always be someone there who can help, so getting looked past sometimes is normal! keep trying and explore avenues to make things happen.<p>

<b>Communication: </b>
if you find yourself in a spot where you can't continue with a project or finish a task, no worries! let the other parties know. just know that it is "all chill", anything can be picked back up by anyone, and you’re free to jump in at any time.<p>

<b>Choose your own adventure:</b>
you have the freedom to participate in a way that suits your preferences and goals. whether you prefer to work independently and just share your awesome work, seek help and guidance, or actively collaborate with others, this category welcomes and supports various levels of involvement. feel free to contribute anything you want, seek assistance, and request any resources you need to bring projects to life.<p>

<b>Stay open:</b>
recognize and respect that everyone brings their unique perspectives and interpretations to the table. remember, the diversity of viewpoints can lead to valuable insights and unexpected creative outcomes. collaborating is being able to let go of a singular idea of something, and let it evolve through the input and work of others. not everyone's ideas or feedback may align with your own vision or expectations, and that's fine! you don't have to commit to anything. be chill and don't take it personally when someone's thoughts don't resonate with your work or vice versa. <p>

these guidelines aim to foster a supportive and collaborative environment within the workshop. by following these principles, we can create a space for imagination to "go wild", and make anything possible with the power of collective work, mutual respect and understanding.<p>
