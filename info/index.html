<h1>Why streaming?</h1><p>
Cable Two prioritizes experimentation in form over content.
Livestreaming is the ability to connect with people and events in a way that feels immediate and unmediated, 
as if the viewer were physically present. Everything happens in the here and now, breaking down physical and boundaries into a singular, shared experience. 
What livestreaming and television does best is fostering patterns for emotional effect with shared events through curation, 
where the outcome is secondary to the connection formed. As livestreaming grew, it took on the form of gaming - which works well for creating shared experiences - 
but why limit ourselves to only one style of content, when the possibilities of the form are endless?<p>

In the digital age, we have the resources and capability to make infinite variations of art through the same curation.<br>
This is the purpose of Cable Two.

<h1>History</h1><p>

  Cable Two, a television network and media project, embarked on its journey in July 2020. 
  It was born out of a shared passion for exploring the creative possibilities of live video as a medium. 
  The founders of Cable Two discovered a forum called Twitter2, where they could express their love for creating innovative and experimental art. 
  This led to the creation of posting.cool, a spiritual successor to Twitter2, where they could experiment with new ideas and soon formed a distinctive group voice.<p>

The team then developed OrbTelevision, a shared Twitch channel that served as a platform for experimental livestreaming. 
After several months of successful operation, the team decided to rebrand the channel as Cable Two. 
This decision marked a commitment to delve deeper into the possibilities of livestreaming as a medium while playing with the form of traditional televised media.<p>

Since its inception, Cable Two has been pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the world of streaming. With a bright future ahead, 
Cable Two continues to evolve, promising endless possibilities for new ideas and experiences to create together.</div>
