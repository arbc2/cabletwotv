Curation: Our shows put an emphasis on experimentation with form, outside of traditional gaming livestreams.<br>
Alliance: Cable Two is not about finding a place to put any stream, but joining a group of people to work towards a common goal.<br>
Borrowing: We play with the visual language of media across time, but are not bound by any individual style aside from our own. Take pieces to create something new.<br>
Limitless: Eddie Morra is a struggling author in New York City. His girlfriend Lindy, frustrated with his lack of progress a<br>
Earnesty: The concept of our streams come from a place of love rather than judgment. Find something you want to do, and follow it.<br>

<h1>Why streaming?</h1><p>
When you’re watching a livestream, you’re there to see something that has never happened, and will never happen again. It’s setting something up to let you see where it takes you. What television and streaming share is their ability to foster shared experiences through curated events in real time. <p>

As livestreaming grew, it began to focus on gaming - which works well for creating shared experiences, using patterns similar to sports - but why limit ourselves to only one style of art, when the possibilities of the form are endless? <p>

We have the resources and capability to make something new.<br>
This is the purpose of Cable Two.

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1><br>
<b>Q:</b> Is Cable Two a retro channel?<br>
<b>A: No. </b> Cable Two is not explicitly a retro channel, nor do we have any specific "style" in our shows beyond what each individual person chooses. We consider ourselves to be modern, and having an anachronistic mixed style is part of our thing. That being said, most of our members have some shared interest across different eras of design. Everything is a remix, and we take that to heart.

<h1>History</h1><p>

Cable Two started as a way for friends to have fun together. <br>
During early 2020, while everyone was at home, the founders of Cable Two discovered a joke forum called Twitter2, 
which was promptly banned after 100,000 posts in two weeks for posting images of women smoking. This led to the creation of another forum, 
a spiritual successor to Twitter2, where we could continue to hang out and joke around, soon forming a distinctive group voice.<p>

We thought it would be cool to livestream together on a single account, imitating the format of classic television, 
because it was funny, and we liked the notion that in this digital age, we can. This led to the creation of OrbTelevision, 
a shared Twitch channel that served as a platform for experimental livestreaming. After several months we decided to rebrand the channel as Cable Two. <p>

Since its inception, Cable Two has been pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the world of streaming, but more than anything, 
it’s a way for us to have fun with each other. We care about everyone in our group, what we’re making, and we’d like to keep doing it. 
Now, we’d like to extend that to others.</div>
