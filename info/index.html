<h1>Why streaming?</h1><p>
Cable Two prioritizes experimentation in form over content.
Livestreaming is the ability to connect with people and events in a way that feels immediate and unmediated, as if the viewer were physically present. Everything happens in the here and now, breaking down physical and boundaries into a singular, shared experience. What livestreaming and television does best is fostering patterns for emotional effect with shared events through curation, where the outcome is secondary to the connection formed. As livestreaming grew, it took on the form of gaming - which works well for creating shared experiences - but why limit ourselves to only one style of content, when the possibilities of the form are endless?<p>

In the digital age, we have the resources and capability to make infinite variations of art through the same curation.<br>
This is the purpose of Cable Two.

<h1>History</h1><p>

Cable Two is a TV network that has been revolutionizing the world of streaming since its launch in July 2020. It all started with a group of people who discovered Twitter2, a forum where they could share their passion for creating innovative and experimental art. This led to the creation of posting.cool, a spiritual successor to Twitter2, where they could play around with new ideas and soon formed a distinctive group voice. From there, they developed OrbTV, a shared Twitch channel that became a platform for forward-thinking and innovative livestreaming.<p>

After several months, the team behind the channel decided to rebrand the channel as Cable Two. They were committed to exploring the possibilities of livestreaming as a medium, while playing with the form of traditional media and fostering a sense of community among their viewers. Since then, Cable Two has continued to push the boundaries of what is possible in the world of streaming, inspiring and entertaining their passionate community of talented creators. With a bright future ahead, Cable Two is constantly evolving, promising endless possibilities for new ideas and experiences to captivate audiences around the world.<p>
