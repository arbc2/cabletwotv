Cable Dogs,
<p>
We at Cable Two have been working hard to bring our vision for the future to life, and we are excited to share with you some ideas we've had for 2023.
<p>
We plan to build a new 24/7 live TV network called The NeTWOrk. This network, a self-hosted FAST channel simulcast on Twitch, will showcase live and replay broadcasts of our beloved Cable Two shows, as well as new and exciting content from our talented team of creators. The NeTWOrk would also be available for mobile and as an app for Smart TVs so you can watch C2 on the silver screen.
<p>
In addition to The NeTWOrk, many of us would like to focus on creating more recorded content - tv shows, movies, short form videos etc - and a start a permanent video archive streaming platform outside of YouTube. 
<p>
We want to ensure that our content is not only entertaining, but also informative and engaging. To that end, we plan to invite special guests and musical guests onto our streams and shows. We are also excited to announce the launch of the Cable Two Podcast, in which team members will discuss streams, projects, and more.
<p>
To keep our community informed and up to date, we will be publishing a weekly newsletter with the schedule for our upcoming shows. We are also working on a marketing strategy and social media schedule to promote Cable Two and the neTWOrk, and a way to edit our streams into highlights and short videos for easy viewing.
<p>
Ultimately, our goal is to ensure the long-term sustainability of the network and provide well-paying jobs for anyone who wants to join our team. We love Cable Two, and want it to be a greater part of our lives. To that end, we are in the process of developing a clear and effective monetization method to allow us to continue creating and sharing great content with our community.

<p>Go to <a href="https://cabletwo.net/support">our Support page</a> or text LETSGOO to (202) 858-1233 to support and help us continue to make exciting streams online.

<p>
We hope you will join us on this exciting journey as we work towards building the future of Cable Two in 2023.<p>
