Gajillion Inc is pleased to announce the acquisition of Cable Two, a digital cable television network known for its innovative programming and strong community of viewers. As part of the acquisition, Cable Two will be transitioning to Cable Three, a fully Three platform presented by our subsidiary, Three's Company. <p>

According to John Gajillion, CBE of Gajillion Inc, "We understand that change can be difficult, but we believe that the switch to Cable Three will provide a much improved viewing experience for our customers. Rest assured, we have worked hard to ensure that all of your favorite Cable Two programming such as Warp Zone, Happy Lab Accidents, and Vox Urodov, will continue to be available on Cable Three."<p>

In addition to the beloved Cable Two programming, Cable Three will also introduce new content and features that are sure to enhance your viewing experience. With the switch to Cable Three, you can expect the next level in crystal clear, reliable picture in 3D (or Three Display) with surround sound.<p>

We encourage all Cable Two viewers to make sure their equipment is properly connected and updated in preparation for the switchover to Cable Three. The final broadcast of Cable Two will be on December 31, 2022, and the first special day of broadcast on Cable Three will be on January 1, 2023. Don't miss out on this exciting milestone in the evolution of our network and join us for these special broadcasts.<p>
