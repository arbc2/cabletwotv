Through our programming, we seek to foster a sense of connection and community, working together to push the boundaries of what is possible in the world of streaming. </span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>At Cable Two, we believe that our mission is nothing less than to revolutionize the way people interact with </span><span>livestreaming</span><span>, and to create a more vibrant, and dynamic media landscape for everyone. Cable Two is a threat and a promise.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.7pfk1aihj2g2"><span class="c6">Why Streaming?</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Cable Two prioritizes experimentation in form over content. Livestreaming is the ability to connect with people and events in a way that feels immediate and unmediated, as if the viewer were physically present. Everything happens in the here and now, breaking down physical and boundaries into a singular, shared experience. What livestreaming and television does best is fostering patterns for emotional effect with shared events through curation, where the outcome is secondary to the connection formed. As livestreaming grew, it took on the form of gaming - which works well for creating shared experiences - but why limit ourselves to only one style of content, when the possibilities of the form are endless?</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>In the digital age, we have the resources and capability to make infinite variations of art through the same curation. This is the purpose of Cable Two.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.bni85zrh9pog"><span class="c6">Mod Team</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As of May 2023, our Mod Team is currently Drazza, Nullcasting, MikeO, Arby, Dana, and Jaunt. Feel free to message us at any time if you need help, or have any questions, comments, or concerns. </span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c14 title" id="h.33y5w94tddxj"><span class="c15">SCHEDULING</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.vpl4ntnniz0a"><span class="c6">Timeslots</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In order to stream your show, you&rsquo;ll need to pick a timeslot - a predetermined time period during which your particular show or event will take place. Timeslots may be defined by the hour, half-hour, or any other predetermined duration depending on the programming of the network and your individual stream! </span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>When we talk about distinct </span><span>timeslots</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;for Cable Two shows, we don&#39;t mean that shows have to start or end exactly at the designated time. Rather, the timeslot is a block of time that&#39;s been set aside for a particular show, with the understanding that the show won&#39;t overlap with any other scheduled programming. </span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>For example, a show may be scheduled to air every Monday at 8pm, occupying a three-hour </span><span>timeslot</span><span>. Another show may be scheduled to air every Wednesday at 9:30pm, occupying an hour and a half timeslot. Each show will require a designated </span><span>timeslot</span><span>, whether weekly, recurring, or as announced. </span><span class="c0">Please note that Cable Two scheduling is based from Central Time (CST/CDT) also </span><span class="c0">known within as</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c13">Cable Time</span><span class="c0 c22">. </span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>To create a timeslot, you&rsquo;ll need to add (or ask a Mod) to add your show to the </span><span class="c5"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid%3DZDM0OWQ4YjlhZWQ1MDVlZjQwMmMzMDc5M2ZiYjgzODFlN2MyYzM1ZGZjN2QxNzZjOGY2MjhhODk0ZWZhNDQ2MUBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1684887808817505&amp;usg=AOvVaw1225rdMXotgc6ey_ARllPZ">Google Schedule here</a></span><span>. There will be a weekly call for this every Sunday! </span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Having distinct timeslots for Cable Two shows is important because it helps to create a consistent viewing experience for our audience, viewers can know when their favorite C2 shows will air and tune in accordingly. This also helps to avoid scheduling conflicts with other events and shows, and allows us to effectively promote streams, as we can advertise at specific times to maximize their reach. </span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.vjrno5yqebb"><span class="c6">Scheduling Commitments</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We understand that life can sometimes get in the way, and unexpected events may occur that prevent you from airing your show on time. In these cases, we ask that you communicate with the mod team as soon as possible so that we can work together to update everything accordingly. </span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We trust all hosts to do their best to stick to their assigned time so that we can maintain a reliable and consistent schedule for our viewers. While we may be online, we consider Cable Two to be a real television network - including all the responsibilities that come with it. </span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.xpivrlo7db4o"><span class="c6">Unscheduled Streams</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Please read the schedule to make sure there are no other planned streams for that time and that it ends before the next scheduled stream. It&#39;s always a good idea to check in with others to make sure no one else already planned on streaming before going live. Please note that this policy may change in the future as our schedule becomes more filled. </span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c14 title" id="h.vb4cb2d6tybf"><span class="c15">PITCHING</span></p><p class="c3"><span>Our focus at the moment may be livestreaming, but Cable Two is an artists&#39; group first and foremost, and we&rsquo;re excited to pursue ideas for all media! We welcome pre-recorded video as well as writing, visual art, and all others, and hope to expand into multiple media as the group continues to create. (That said, the below mostly refers to the process of establishing an episodic show streamed live on Twitch).<br><br></span><span>All new show proposals must go through the pitch form on the </span><span class="c5"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://cabletwo.net/pitch&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1684887808818769&amp;usg=AOvVaw09R8f36PSL2EAuUz8LJsAF">Cable Two website</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">and be approved by the team before production can begin. The pitch form includes details such as the show title, a brief summary of the concept, and visuals. </span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When you submit your pitch, it is sent to the Cable Two email and then shared with the current Stream Team. After the Stream Team discusses their first impressions and the mods approve your pitch, you will be added to the Stream Team, where you can continue to develop your show before going live. This includes receiving help with graphics, branding, music, stream assets and setup, and anything else you might need. If you have an idea but are unsure how to produce it or don&#39;t feel you have the necessary skills, the Stream Team is there to help!</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">If the mods are unsatisfied with your pitch, &nbsp;we will communicate with you our questions or concerns before we consider denying your pitch. This may result in asking you to re-submit your pitch after developing it a bit further. </span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s also possible for us to deny your pitch as a streaming show specifically, so that we can encourage you to pursue the idea in another medium. In this case, you would still receive development support from the Stream Team for whatever aspects you may want help with.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We encourage all creators to thoroughly consider their show ideas before submitting them and to include as much detail as possible to help the mod team understand the concept fully. This process helps us figure out the best way to help you make your stream, and ensures that all shows meet the standards of Cable Two.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15">CHECKLIST</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.x9p6pkb3xn85"><span class="c6">Stream Key</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The Stream Key is essentially a password code that connects your stream program to our</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Twitch channel. It&rsquo;s very long. Message a member of the mod team to receive the Stream Key. Do not give the Stream Key out to anybody! Keep your secrets, Cable Dog.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.oiq964z1hcff"><span class="c6">Stream Title / Category</span></h2><p class="c3"><span>To update the Title and Category of your stream, you will need to ask a moderator or member of the Mod Team to update it, or add you to our list of editors/moderators for the Twitch channel. A direct message or a simple post in the Discord is fine!</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.69pvb8k21lt3"><span class="c6">Browser Sources</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Add them each as an individual &ldquo;browser source&rdquo; in your stream software.
