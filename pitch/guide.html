<center> <h1>THE CABLE TWO PITCH GUIDE</h1>
 <h2>What are the steps of the pitch process?</h2>

<div id="rulesbox">
Here's a quick overview detailing how to make your best pitch for Cable Two!<p>

<b>Idea:</b> Start by brainstorming a base concept for your show. What kind of show do you want to create? What do you want to articulate? Think about what kind of content you would like to produce and what would make it unique in the world of livestreaming. Feel free to experiment and go wild with form - this can be anything from a fully themed, fleshed out concept to sitting still, facing away from the camera for an hour. Find something that makes you feel excited, and go for it. <p>

<b>Needs, Requirements, and Constraints:</b> Once you have an idea for your show, figure out what you need to make it a reality. Do you need any resources?  How does your show fit our standards? What are your constraints, such as budget, time, equipment or technical expertise? This step will help you determine what is possible now, and how to make the most of your resources and idea, as well as help us figure out how we can help you make anything a reality. <p>

<b>Development:</b> Develop your pitch by fully fleshing out your show idea. This includes creating a synopsis, outlining your format, and detailing the what you plan to cover. Be specific and provide as much detail as possible for clarity to help us understand your vision. It's all about theming and curation.<p>

<b>Design:</b> Come up with visuals to help us visualize your show. This can include things like logos, title cards, overlay mockups, mood boards, and inspiration images. If you're not comfortable creating these yourself, we can help with graphics to bring your vision to life - just send us your idea or inspiration!<p>

<b>Pitch:</b> Submit your show pitch to Cable Two by filling out our pitch submission form. If we accept your pitch, we will get back to you as soon as possible to start the show process. Join our Discord server to communicate with us more easily and get feedback on your pitch. Our job is to figure out how to make your dreams work within the context of our network.<p>

<b>Construction:</b> Once your show is approved, it's time to build and construct all the pieces that make it work. This includes setting up your streaming equipment, creating visuals and content, and planning out your format.<p>

<b>Standards and Scheduling:</b> Make sure your stream fits Cable Two's graphics and technical standards, which we will provide to you. You'll also need to schedule your show for specific times to ensure it fits into our programming schedule.<p>

<b>Launch:</b> Once everything is set up and ready to go, it's time to premiere your show! We'll promote it on our social media channels and provide you with ongoing support to help you make your stream everything you want it to be.<p>

Awoooo! That's it. Good luck with your pitch!</div></center>
